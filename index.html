	<h1><center>PHOTOGRAPHY FROM A HIMALAYAN JOURNEY</center></h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There's no place on Earth like the Himalayas. The environment is by nature alien to the physiological functions of the human body. if an individual is not acclimated to high altitudes begin with, then a physical process of adjustment has to take place over time, and that process varies from one individual to the next. For those who are native to the environment of high altitudes, then such adjustment for them is likely unnecessary.</p>
<p>The world that exists at high altitudes is for most people inaccessible, but for those who make the journey, then the experience can be unforgettable. Some people end up wanting to go back. For people like me that experience has been magical.</p>
<p>The locale, people and cultures that exist in the Himalayan mountain ranges are unique. The most natural way for me to document what I've seen has been with my camera.</p>
